# TODO
### Initial settlements
 - [x] Add a check if we have passed the turn since starting it, so we don't send the message to build the settlement twice (necessary because colonist.io likes to send the turn information twice for some reason)  
 - [ ] Only count open settlement spots to calculate the settelent index
 - [ ] Place road (random is fine for now)  
 - [ ] End turn
