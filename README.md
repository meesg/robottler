# TODO
### Initial settlements
 - [x] Add a check if we have passed the turn since starting it, so we don't send the message to build the settlement twice (necessary because colonist.io likes to send the turn information twice for some reason)  
 - [x] Fix bug where findHighestProducingSpot only counts open settlement spots to calculate the settlement index
 - [ ] Place road (random is fine for now)  
 - [ ] End turn
