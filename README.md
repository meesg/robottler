# TODO
### General
 - [ ] Make sure userscript runs before other javascript to make sure WebSocket is intercepted (right now it seems like a 50/50 sometimes)

### Bug fixes
 - [ ] Continue turn after making trade with bank
 - [ ] Keep track of turn information better

### Strategy
 - [ ] Place initial settlements based on a score, which takes into account: current production, new production, harbor
 - [ ] Think multiple steps ahead in trade (road -> settlement)

### Trade
 - [ ] Create 1:1 trades with opponent, 2:1 if it is a resource with < 3 own production

### Development cards
 - [ ] Play knight cards when possible
